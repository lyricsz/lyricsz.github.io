                <h2>Introudction</h2>
                <p>Hello World! Welcome to <strong>Lyricsz Official Webpage</strong>. I assure you, you're in a very good luck to be here right now... Lyrics, Games, Apps, Assets, Tutorials and lot more. 
                    Things get complicated, so i'ld recommend you <a href="#games"> scroll down</a> for "<b>Action Start</b>". </p>
                <p>First of all, who are we? We are lyricsz/fun pack/spinditty band. We're a music band named spinditty (The Africa "Spinditty" not the latter with same band name)... But the band has been dismissed. 
                </p>
                <p>Lyricsz was first created back in june, 2021... A facebook page with an intent of sharing lyrics on facebook so users won't have to do the work of Googling :D. That was all about the first series
                    (series or revolution) of <strong>Lyricsz</strong>. </p>
                <p>
                    Time for the present! Now, things have changed. I run this now. You can call me PJ Dev. I'm a web developer and an indie game dev. But that aside, the other two members: Stakin (web developer), and G-Crown 
                    (A singer). 
                </p>
                <p>Where are we? Oh! The present! And how things have changed! Did you love song lyrics? Well, you can have em for free... If you're an artist also we can help you with your song lyrics video / upload the text-based 
                version here. (I know Google said if a website promise what is too much to be good they're a scam --- which we're not because 90% of our services are free)
                </p>
                <p>Here's a twist... Did you love Games / Apps / Assets (Images used in games --- including sounds, fonts, e.t.c.) / Tutorials on how to make these cool stuffs... Then you're in for a treat!!! 
                    Whoopie! I talk too much. Have fun around and i'll see you in the next sub-section. 
                </p>

                <h2> Lyrics </h2>
                <p>
                    Song lyrics! Song lyrics!! Song lyrics!!! All the whole lyricsz stuffs seems like a joke to me when i was first introduced to copyright... To all of us actually. So, there's a privacy and policy. If any 
                    team / band / artist / companies thinks or thought that we have violated their rules... A copyright infrigement notice should please be sent via our contact forms, and we promise to take immediate effect. 
                    (We'll be using "Fair Use", just in case you don't like that).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enough about the whole copyright stuffs! Let's jump right into the realm of lyrics... I used to believe in this saying "Listening to a song is less better than knowing it"! Lyrics let's us feel the song... 
                    We feel worth of the song if we know the lyrics, makes us happy and e.t.c. Songs are great and Huge Bravo to our artists! They did great... Really great if i must say. So are you ready for some fun with song lyrics? 
                    The Song Lyrics Page was design to help users navigate around the webpage as easy as possible :D Have fun!
                </p>
                <p>And if you're an artist, i don't believe i should say much :XD Just contact us and you'll be glad you did! We might promise you that as long as you cooperate :D </p>
                <p>Hope you have lot fun visiting our <a href="/lyrics">Lyrics Page</a></p>

                <h2> Games </h2>
                <p>Games are fun! And some of PJ Dev's dream is to make games... Making games is fun just as playing them, so hang on if you're fans of games (both 2d and 3d) because your treat is special.</p>
                <p>We listen to feedbacks of our players always :D. So have any ideas for improvement or found a bug / others then comments on our games... Most of our games are Android build / Online. (Most are online games which 
                    makes our games playable in every platform with a web browser). Have fun!
                </p>
                <p>There are a lot of benefit in playing game and here is a <a href="https://gamequitters.com/positive-effects-of-video-games/" target="_blank"> good reference, my guy! </a></p>

                <h2> About </h2>
                <p> On September 2020, Lyricsz page on facebook was first created and was proposed to start function around May, 2021. Till date with an exception of not focusing actively on Facebook.</p>
                <p> Lyricsz was created by a team of enthusiastic. With a simple question in mind, why must it be difficult to find a song lyrics online? Or to figured out if it was correct or not? Or why should someone try to answer this question before having the confident that he/she now knew the song? All this are the motives for the creation of Lyricsz back then, and it quickly grew out of hands. </p>
                <p> It was first renamed Spinditty, named after a band... The creator of Lyricsz owns a band named SPINDITTY. Apparently, Lyricsz still stood for a very long time and we have no intention of changing the name, whether now or in the future. </p>
                <p> The main purpose for the creation of Lyricsz has been diversify in it's early years, now the team are focsuing more on features like Lyrics Video creation, Game creation, A site dedicated to artist all over the world to collaborate, App creation and lots more. This has nothing to do with the main vision and the creator has no guarantee of any kind that the current goal won't be diversified in the future. But as of current, you can have access to our lyrics page, our stories page, our games page, our apps page, our tutorials page, and lot more.
