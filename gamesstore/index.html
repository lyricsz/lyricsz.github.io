            <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello world!. And welcome. Welcome to the <strong>Official Lyricsz Games Store Homepage</strong>. Huh! That was quite a mouthful(don't worry, i'm a little bit talkative). 
            </p>
            <p>First of all, We're here because of one thing: <strong>GAMES</strong>. Either 2d or 3d games... I assure you, you'll find them here. But in addition to that, you can download our apps, and even learn how we made these things... I'm pretty sure you'll like it here. </p>
            <p>But before we get started, 3d games is still under process. Most of the games here are 2d games and they can be played directly from your web browser. We've always and will always recommend <b>Google Chrome</b> for our users, but <b>Safari</b> works well too. 
            </p>
            <p>Let's get started ===> </p>
        </section>
        <section id="gamesandapps" role="search">
            <h2 class="h2">Games and Apps</h2>
            <p>Games first, then apps. Because we love games... I love games (they're fun to play, and create)... And there are 90% chances that same goes for you. We both like games. To avoid a huge list of games over here, there is a <a href="./gamesandapps"> seperate page for a comprehensive list of games... </a></p>
            <h3> Games </h3>
            <aside id="games">
                <table id="gameTable">
                </table>
            </aside>
            <p>Now let's move on to <b>APPS</b>: </p>
            <h3> Apps </h3>
            <aside id="apps">
                <table id="appTable">
                </table>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section id="tutorials">
            <h2 class="h2">Tutorials</h2>
            <p>I love tutorials. But please and please as a programmer, don't get stuck in <a href="">Tutorial Hell</a>. </p>
            <p>These sections is only about tutorials. These tutorials are based on apps/games that are on this site. They are free and you can access them anytime of the day. (Found a game you like and wondered how they built it? The help is here). </p>

        </section>
        <section id="prosandcons">
            <h2 class="h2">Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p>So, it's been great so far and i feel that. And believed we all feel similar. The Games are great. The apps are sensibly made. But does it really benefit any of us by the way? If it does what are the offs? </p>
            <p>Let's dive deeper on <b>Why or Not</b> you should be coming here everyday: </p>
            <h3>Advantages & Disadvantages</h3>

                        <td class="cell">All might not be completely free in the future. Especially since we're planning an assets store. </td>

                    <tr>
                        <td class="cell">Browser games. Fully responsive with full mobile support. </td>
                        <td class="cell">Lack of support in case you ran into some bugs... You can only comment on the itch page, and hopefully it was fixed. </td>

                        <td class="cell">Lack of 3d and Multiplayer's game. Games are usually not that unique (for now). </td>
